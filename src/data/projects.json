I have put all of my past designs in the screenshots below, most are built when I was a teaching assistant at University of Washington. \n\n Some interesting facts about this website: When you link to it from other places, the open graph image displayed will show the current star chart above the city I'm living in right now.",

It's updated frequently enough that I decided to add a version number to each build.\n\nA bit of history to this project: originally, I made the [summon screen generator](https://spam.bychao.com/DLSummonScreenGenerator) to make fake images of summoned characters as a bit of a meme. The project was written in vanilla JS. Later on the [first version of dialogue screen generator](https://spam.bychao.com/DLDialogueScreenGenerator) was created using the same underlying code. It quickly became a bit too overwhelming to handle with just vanilla JS, so I started learning React, and rewrote this project as practice.",
