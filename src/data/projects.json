The design of the page is inspired by Devoid, a game I made in a past game jam \n There has been a few iterations in the design for my personal website over the last few years. I have put all of my past designs in the screenshots below, most are built when I was a teaching assistant at University of Washington. \n Some interesting facts about this website: When you link to it from other places, the open graph image displayed will show the current star chart above the city I'm living in right now.",
      "zh_tw": "也就是現在這個網頁。採用React框架架設的單頁面靜態網頁，會動的背景受到了我之前的遊戲作品《空無》中藝術風格的影響。\n在最近幾年，我的個人網頁經過了許多的變動。在下方可以看到我曾經使用過的個人頁面設計，大部分都是我在華盛頓大學的網頁入門課程擔任助教時所使用的個人網頁。\n這個網站其實還有個有趣的小秘密：在社群軟體中分享這個頁面的時候，在網頁的預覽圖中可以看到高雄目前正上方的星空喔"
